RipFinder WebView is a feature of the RipFinder project that embeds real-time coastal data from external websites directly into the application. This allows users to view up-to-date surf forecasts, weather reports, and safety information alongside RipFinder’s rip current detection results.

## Purpose

The WebView provides important context by integrating live data sources such as NOAA surf forecasts. This helps users understand ocean conditions in real time while using RipFinder’s detection system.

## How It Works

Embeds selected external websites directly into RipFinder.
Updates dynamically as the source website refreshes.
Ensures users always have access to the latest information.
